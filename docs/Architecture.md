## JWT & auth

- **Cookie**: `fc_session` (httpOnly, sameSite=lax, secure in production)
- **Algorithm**: HS256 with `JWT_SECRET`, issuer `fitclass-crm`, audience `fitclass-crm:web`
- **Password watermark**: `pwd_iat = floor(password_changed_at / 1000)`. `/auth/me` rejects any session where `payload.pwd_iat < db.passwordChangedAt`. This invalidates all sessions when a password is reset.
- **Gateway**: validates JWT with `jose` (Edge-compatible). Injects `X-User-Id`, `X-User-Role`, `X-Org-Id`, `X-Rank`, `X-Tenant-Id` headers onto every proxied request. Also injects `X-Internal-Secret` so downstream services can verify the request came through the gateway.
- **Services**: never re-verify the JWT — they trust the injected headers from the gateway. They reject requests missing `X-Internal-Secret`.

## Database pools

Three postgres.js pools exist, all with `transform: { column: { from: postgres.toCamel } }`:

| Pool | Connection | RLS | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `appDb()` | `DATABASE_URL` (app_user) | Enabled | Org-scoped reads/writes |
| `tenantDb()` | `DATABASE_URL_TENANT` (tenant_admin) | Enabled (tenant scope) | Cross-org reads within a tenant |
| `serviceDb()` | `DATABASE_URL_SERVICE` (crm_service) | BYPASSRLS | System operations |

### Transaction helpers

- **`withRoleTx(ctx, fn)`** — Dispatches based on `ctx.role`: `super_admin` uses serviceDb, `tenant_admin` uses tenantDb, others use appDb with `SET LOCAL ROLE app_user` + GUCs.
- **`withServiceTx(fn)`** — No role switch, BYPASSRLS. Used for auth lookups, seed scripts, activity logging, and webhook ingestion.

## Row Level Security

RLS is enabled on `crm.marketing_leads`, `iam.users`, `marketing.ad_campaigns`, `crm.lead_interactions`, `crm.lead_follow_ups`, `crm.lead_assignment_log`, `crm.lead_status_log`, `ext.meta_org_config`, `ext.meta_leads`, `ext.meta_lead_custom_fields`, and `ext.meta_capi_outbound_logs`. Each table has:

- `org_isolation_policy` (TO app_user): restricts rows to `org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid`

Some tables also have:
- `tenant_isolation_policy` (TO tenant_admin): restricts rows to orgs belonging to `current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')::uuid`

`crm_service` has `BYPASSRLS` and is unaffected by these policies.

## Assignment model

Assignments are **not** a separate table. The assignment is stored as `crm.marketing_leads.assigned_user_id`. The assignments-service queries and updates `crm.marketing_leads` directly. Assignment ID in API responses = Lead ID.

## Activity logging

Fire-and-forget: every service calls activities-service via HTTP (no `await` on the fetch result, errors swallowed). This ensures activity logging never blocks or fails a user-facing request.

## Meta Conversion API

Bidirectional integration with Meta (Facebook) Lead Ads:

### Inbound flow (Meta → CRM)
1. Meta sends a webhook POST to `/meta/webhook/:integrationId` through the gateway
2. Gateway forwards raw bytes (not re-serialized JSON) via `proxyToRaw()` for HMAC integrity
3. Meta-conversion-api looks up `ext.meta_org_config` by the integration ID to get per-org credentials
4. HMAC-SHA256 verification using the org's `app_secret`
5. Fetches full lead data from Meta Graph API using the org's `access_token`
6. Creates a `crm.marketing_leads` row (source=facebook, stage=new) and a linked `ext.meta_leads` row
7. Unmapped form fields stored in `ext.meta_lead_custom_fields`

### Outbound flow (CRM → Meta CAPI)
- **Auto-trigger**: When a lead's stage changes, leads-service fires a fire-and-forget HTTP call to meta-conversion-api. The service checks if the new stage is in `ext.meta_org_config.capi_trigger_stages` and sends a CAPI event if so.
- **Manual trigger**: `POST /meta/crm-event` (protected, JWT-authenticated) allows users to manually send conversion events.
- PII is SHA256-hashed before transmission. Deterministic `event_id` ensures Meta deduplication.
- Partial unique index on `ext.meta_capi_outbound_logs(marketing_lead_id, event_name) WHERE delivery_status = 'SUCCESS'` prevents duplicate events.

## Permissions

Role rank is an integer (0–100). The gateway injects `X-Rank` and services use it for authorization:

| Role | Rank |
|---|---|
| read_only | 0 |
| sales_representative | 20 |
| senior_sales_executive | 40 |
| org_manager | 60 |
| org_sr_manager | 70 |
| org_admin | 80 |
| tenant_admin | 90 |
| super_admin | 100 |

`can_assign_to(org_id, acting_user_id, target_user_id)` is a PostgreSQL function (3-param, SECURITY DEFINER). Managers and senior roles may assign within their subtree via `vw_user_team_members`; admins and tenant_admins may assign within/across their org/tenant.

## Shared packages

All packages live in `packages/` and are consumed via workspace references (`@crm/*`). They compile to ESM via `tsc` (`"module": "NodeNext"`). Services import from them; they never import from each other (no circular deps).

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `@crm/db` | Connection pools, Drizzle schema, transaction helpers, blocklist |
| `@crm/types` | Shared TypeScript interfaces |
| `@crm/validation` | Zod schemas for request validation |
| `@crm/permissions` | RANKS object, permission check helpers |
| `@crm/auth-constants` | AUTH_COOKIE_NAME and other auth constants |
| `@crm/internal-client` | HTTP client for inter-service calls |
